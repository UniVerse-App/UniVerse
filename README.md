# Best Practices 

## General Git Stuff

For more general info on git, see this [series on the basics](https://www.atlassian.com/git)

## Git Flow

We will use the git flow methodology to maintain our code and ensure we all stay in sync.  Here is some [good documentation on the git flow methodology](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) written by Atlassian. 

It is reccomended that everyone install the git-flow package which adds a couple of helper commands that will make the gitflow methodology easier to follow.  

On ubuntu you can install with `apt-get install git-flow` or on MacOS, use homebrew `brew install git-flow`

Once the git-flow library is installed, you can reference the [git-flow docs](https://git-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#) for help.
